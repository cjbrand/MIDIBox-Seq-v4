Design files and BOMs for [MIDIBox Seq v4](http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_seq.html)
=================================================================================

This is a collection of [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com) BOMs and vector files for case plans to cut an acrylic case at [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com).


IMPORTANT
---------

This is a variation of the standard BOMs and layouts found on the MIDIBox forum and wiki's.

This version uses short-throw switches instead of tact switches. These switches use different switch caps, and as such the designs will not work directly with the layouts supplied by Wilba for the PANEL_CS PCB.


Status
------

This project is near complete, but the BOMs need minor modifications and the case vectors need to be adjusted to better accommodate kerf on the laser cutter at Ponoko (it currently overcompensates and does not totally sandwich together).
